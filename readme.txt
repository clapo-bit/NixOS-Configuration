SOME OF THIS SYSTEM IS NON MODULAR

The user MUST be called jamal, the system MUST be called nixos and the directory of all your config files MUST be in ~/nixos, manual setup of rclone and git might be needed. Theming should be easy but definately manual for some programs.

Home manager is modularised in ./home with some programs configrued with .nix options,some are syslinked configs and neovim is managed with nvf for ease of use.

Happy Hacking!!
